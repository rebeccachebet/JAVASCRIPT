   -  when it gets the marks, it should check for the best mark from the two and return it
   -  create another function for coursework mark requiring one parameter  -  a coursework mark, check it
      then get average of coursework and return current coursework value
   -  write the final function that takes a single parameter, computes the mark exam , as well as final Exam        mark.

    what is the exam mark of the student ?

   */

// this function finds the bestdone exam between two tests
  function testmarks(a,b){
  c = a>b?a:b
 console.log("the answer is the bestdone exam  " +c)
  }

//this function finds the best done between coursework and bestdone exams
  function bestmark(coursework,bestdone){
  var cwm = 70
  d = cwm>c?cwm:c
  console.log("the answer is the bestdone btn coursework and exams  " +d)
return d
}

//this function averages the coursework mark and bestdone exams
function average(cwm){
   var cwmbestdone = testmarks(40,60) + cwm
   var verybestmark = cwmbestdone / 2
   console.log("this answer shoes the average btn the coursework mark and the bestdone exam  " +verybestmark)
